- Load graph from file

- Build a query node from search input (this is now the root of our search graph)

- Perform a matching function (TBC exactly how this works) against the root node of main data graph
    - Traverse the main data graph appropriately, performing the above scoring function against child nodes
    - For each result, build up the search graph, with scores
